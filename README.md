# Smart Tools Web Application

Smart Tools is a web application that provides users with several useful tools such as a calculator, notepad, timer, calendar, currency converter, and measurement converter, all easily accessible via a responsive user interface. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Calculator**: A basic calculator that supports standard arithmetic operations.
- **Notepad**: A simple notepad for taking quick notes.
- **Timer**: A countdown timer that counts down to a specified date and time.
- **Calendar**: A basic calendar module for date selection.
- **Currency Converter**: A tool to convert between different currencies (API integration required).
- **Measurement Converter**: A unit converter for various measurements.

## Project Structure

```bash
.
├── index.html          # Main HTML structure for the website
├── style.css           # Custom CSS styling for the web app
├── custom.js           # JavaScript functionality (modals, calculator, timer, etc.)
├── README.md           # This file
└── assets/             # Folder for images and icons
    └── bg.png          # Background image for the hero section
    └── icons/          # Icons for the smart tools (calculator, notepad, etc.)
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A text editor (e.g., VS Code).
- A modern web browser for testing (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have a folder structure like shown above, and all the files (HTML, CSS, JS, and assets) are placed in the right folders.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to preview the website.

### How to Use

1. **Navigating the Website**: 
   - Use the top navigation bar to move between the Home, Tools, About, and Contact pages (Note: these sections can be further developed).
   
2. **Using the Tools**:
   - The tools are presented in circular buttons. Clicking on any of the buttons opens a modal window with the respective tool.
   - The available tools include:
     - **Calculator**: For basic arithmetic operations.
     - **Notepad**: (Placeholder) You can expand this tool to allow note-saving functionality.
     - **Timer**: Set a countdown timer with a target date and time.
     - **Currency Converter**: (Requires API integration) You can connect a third-party currency exchange API to fetch live data.
     - **Measurement Converter**: (To be implemented) Customize it for unit conversions.

### Customization

1. **Background Image**: The background image for the hero section is set via the `bg.png` file. Replace this image in the `assets` folder with one of your own for customization.
2. **Icons**: The tool icons are placed inside the `assets/icons/` directory. Replace the default icons with your own as needed.
3. **Modals**: The modals for each tool can be customized by modifying the relevant sections in the `index.html` and adding new functionality to `custom.js`.

### Adding New Tools
To add a new tool:
1. Create a new modal for the tool in `index.html`.
2. Style the tool's interface in `style.css`.
3. Write the logic for the tool's behavior in `custom.js`.

### Dependencies
- No external libraries are required to run this project. It's built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Future Improvements
- **Backend Integration**: Implement user authentication (Login and Sign-up) by integrating a backend with a database.
- **API for Currency Converter**: Integrate with a currency exchange API like [ExchangeRate-API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) for live currency conversion.
- **Persistent Notepad**: Use local storage or a database to save the notes entered by users.
- **Responsive Design**: Enhance the responsiveness of the website for mobile and tablet users.
